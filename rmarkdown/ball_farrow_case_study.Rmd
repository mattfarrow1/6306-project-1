## How many breweries are present in each state?

In addition to producing a table of the count of breweries in each state, we also created a map to visualize the distribution of breweries around the country.

```{r breweries-per-state}
# Count the breweries by state
breweries_by_st <- breweries %>% 
  count(state) %>% 
  rename(brewery_count = n,
         st = state) %>% 
  mutate(state = tolower(state.name[match(st,state.abb)])) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(state)) %>% 
  select(state, brewery_count)

# Merge states map with brewery data
breweries_by_st_map <- left_join(map_data("state"), breweries_by_st, by = c("region" = "state"))

# Create the breweries by state map
ggplot(breweries_by_st_map, aes(long, lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(fill = brewery_count), color = "white") +

    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#f3f3f2", color = NA),
  )

# Because there isn't a clean way to wrap columns using the gt() function, we've
# split the data into three separate data sets then bound the columns of each
# set back together to simulate three columns of data.
by_st1 <- breweries_by_st %>% 
  arrange(desc(brewery_count)) %>% 
  slice(1:17)
by_st2 <- breweries_by_st %>% 
  arrange(desc(brewery_count)) %>% 
  slice(18:34)
by_st3 <- breweries_by_st %>% 
  arrange(desc(brewery_count)) %>% 
  slice(35:51) %>% 
  add_row()
bind_cols(by_st1,
          by_st2,
          by_st3) %>% 
  gt() %>% 
  tab_header(title = "How Many Breweries are Present in Each State?") %>% 
  cols_label(`state...1` = "State",
             `brewery_count...2` = "Count",
             `state...3` = "State",
             `brewery_count...4` = "Count",
             `state...5` = "State",
             `brewery_count...6` = "Count") %>%
  {.}

# Create a table of the top 10 states for breweries
breweries %>% 
  count(state) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  slice(1:10) %>%
  gt() %>% 
  tab_header(title = "Top 10 States") %>% 
  cols_label(state = "State",
             n = "Breweries") 

# Create a table of the bottom 10 states for breweries
breweries %>% 
  count(state) %>% 
  arrange(n) %>%
  slice(1:10) %>%
  gt() %>% 
  tab_header(title = "Bottom 10 States") %>% 
  cols_label(state = "State",
             n = "Breweries") 
```

The top three states are Colorado (47), California (39), and Michigan (32). The bottom three states are North Dakota (1), South Dakota (1), and West Virginia (1). 

## Merge Beer & Breweries Data

After taking a look at the brewery data, we next merged it with the beer data in order to start our analysis of alcohol by volume (ABV) and international bitterness units (IBU). We'll take a look at the data after we merged it to make sure everything looks ok. 

```{r merge-beer-brew}
# Merge the beer and brewery data sets
beer_brew <- left_join(beers, breweries, by = c("brewery_id" = "brew_id"))

# Clean up column names post-merge
beer_brew <- beer_brew %>% 
  rename(beer_name = name.x,
         brewery_name = name.y)

# Look at the first six observations
beer_brew %>% 
  slice_head(n = 6) %>% 
  gt() %>% 
  tab_header(title = "First Six Observations")

# Look at the last six observations
beer_brew %>% 
  slice_tail(n = 6) %>% 
  gt() %>% 
  tab_header(title = "Last Six Observations")
```

## Address Missing Values

Now that the data was successfully merged together, we began the process of investigating and addressing the missing values in the data set. Unfortunately there are a number of missing values, particularly when it comes to ABV and IBU. After examining the histograms for those two variables, we made two decisions. The first was to exclude cider and mead from the analysis because they are not beer. The second was to impute the mean ABV and IBU value by beer style for all missing values of those variables. We felt that offered the best balance between not losing observations and staying true to the beer's style. Our final task for this question was to simply remove any remaining observations with missing values.

```{r address-na}
# How many missing values do we currently have in the data?
colSums(is.na(beer_brew))

# What is the distribution of ABV and IBU before imputation?
hist(beer_brew$abv)
hist(beer_brew$ibu)

# Check which styles are NA for ABV and IBU
filter(beer_brew, ibu == "NaN")
filter(beer_brew, abv == "NaN")

# Get rid of cider and mead because they are not beer
beer_brew <- beer_brew %>%
  filter((style != "Cider") & (style != "Mead"))
  
# Create a function to impute the mean
impute_mean <- function(x) {
  ind_na <- is.na(x)
  x[ind_na] <- mean(x[!ind_na])
  as.numeric(x)
}

# Calculate mean IBU & ABV
beer_brew <- beer_brew %>% 
  group_by(style) %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(ibu, abv), impute_mean) %>% 
  ungroup()

# Distribution of ABV and IBU after imputation
hist(beer_brew$abv)
hist(beer_brew$ibu)

# Check for any remaining NA
colSums(is.na(beer_brew))

# Still a stubborn 10 rows that are NA - this is because these styles don't have
# IBU. Remove these rows
beer_brew <- beer_brew %>% 
  drop_na(ibu)

# Check for any remaining NA
colSums(is.na(beer_brew))
```

## Median ABV & IBU

Using our merged data, we created a new data set to investigate the distribution of median ABV and IBU by state. For this question we made the decision to use histograms that were arranged in descending order from largest median to the smallest. 

```{r median-abv-ibu}
# Median ABV & IBU
median_abv_ibu <- beer_brew %>% 
  filter(state != "DC") %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarise(median_abv = median(abv, na.rm = TRUE),
            median_ibu = median(ibu, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  rename(st = state) %>% 
  mutate(state = tolower(state.name[match(st,state.abb)]),
         median_abv_per = median_abv * 100) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(3,5), names_to = "measure")

# ABV Histogram
median_abv_ibu %>%
  filter(measure == "median_abv_per") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(state, -value), y = value)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "darkolivegreen4") +
  labs(title ="Median Alcohol by Volume for Each State",
       x = "State",
       y = "ABV (%)") +
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(angle = 90))  +
  theme_minimal() +
  NULL

# Save the ABV histogram to the images folder
# ggsave(
#   here::here("images", "median abv by state.png"),
#   dpi = "retina",
#   width = 10,
#   height = 3,
#   units = "in"
# )

# IBU Histogram
median_abv_ibu %>%
  filter(measure == "median_ibu") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(state, -value), y = value)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "goldenrod1") +
  labs(title ="Median IBU for Each State",
       x = "State",
       y = "IBU") +
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(angle = 90))  +
  theme_minimal() +
  NULL

# Save the ABV histogram to the images folder
# ggsave(
#   here::here("images", "median ibu by state.png"),
#   dpi = "retina",
#   width = 10,
#   height = 3,
#   units = "in"
# )
```

Delaware and West Virginia have the highest median IBU, but only include two beers per state. After that, Minnesota has the highest median IBU at 45 and includes a total of 12 breweries.

Kentucky has the highest median ABV at 6.5%.

### Mapping the Data Instead

While the histograms offer a quick look at the median distribution and an assessment of which state has the highest and lowest median values, we also thought it would be interesting to once again map the data to see if there were regional trends that might be hiding in the data. 

```{r}
# Re-make the median_abv_ibu data set without the pivot longer and highlights
median_abv_ibu <- beer_brew %>% 
  filter(state != "DC") %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarise(median_abv = median(abv, na.rm = TRUE),
            median_ibu = median(ibu, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  rename(st = state) %>% 
  mutate(state = tolower(state.name[match(st,state.abb)]),
         median_abv_per = median_abv * 100)

# Merge the state and beer data together
median_map <- left_join(map_data("state"), median_abv_ibu, by = c("region" = "state"))

# Use the map function to get the polygon data, then find the centroids
state_poly <- maps::map("state",  plot=FALSE, fill = TRUE)

# Define state centroids to plot values on states
state_centroids <- maps:::apply.polygon(state_poly, maps:::centroid.polygon)

# Create a data frame for graphing out of the centroids of each polygon
# with a non-missing name
state_centroids <- state_centroids[!is.na(names(state_centroids))]
centroid_array <- Reduce(rbind, state_centroids)
dimnames(centroid_array) <-
  list(gsub("[^,]*,", "", names(state_centroids)),
       c("long", "lat"))
label_df <- as.data.frame(centroid_array)
label_df$state <- rownames(label_df)

# Remove extra names
label_df <- label_df[-c(20, 22, 34, 36, 37, 38, 40, 53, 54, 56, 57, 58, 59), ]

# Remove subregion 
label_df$state <- str_extract(label_df$state, "[a-z ]+")

# Join label data with median_abv_ibu value
median_map_label <- left_join(label_df, median_abv_ibu, by = c("state" = "state"))

# Create a map of median IBU by state with value
ggplot(median_map, aes(long, lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(fill = median_ibu), color = "white") +
  geom_text(data = median_map_label,
            aes(label = round(median_ibu, digits = 1), group = state),
            size = 3) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  labs(title = "Median IBU by State",
       fill = "Median IBU") +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  coord_map() +
  theme_void()

# Save the map to the images folder
# ggsave(here::here("images", "median ibu by state map.png"), dpi = "retina")

# Create a map of median ABV by state with value
ggplot(median_map, aes(long, lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(fill = median_abv), color = "white") +
  geom_text(data = median_map_label,
            aes(label = round(median_abv_per, digits = 1), group =
                  state),
            size = 2.75) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  labs(title = "Median ABV by State",
       fill = "Median ABV (%)") +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  coord_map() +
  theme_void()

# Save the map to the images folder
# ggsave(here::here("images", "median abv by state map.png"), dpi = "retina")

#which are the high IBU beers in DE, WV
beer_brew %>% 
  filter(state == "DE" | state == "WV")

#which are the low & high ABV beers in UT, WV
beer_brew %>% 
  filter(state == "UT" | state == "WV")
```

## Max ABV & IBU

To determine which beer had the highest ABV and IBU, respectively, we arranged the data set in descending order by the desired variable and kept only the top record. The state with the highest ABV was Colorado and the state with the highest IBU was Oregon.

```{r}
# Highest ABV
beer_brew %>% 
  arrange(desc(abv)) %>% 
  filter(row_number() == 1)

# Highest IBU
beer_brew %>% 
  arrange(desc(ibu)) %>% 
  filter(row_number() == 1)
```

## ABV Summary Stats and Distribution

Comment on the summary statistics and distribution of the ABV variable.

```{r}
# Histogram of ABV
beer_brew %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = abv)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = bud_red, color = "gray90") +
  scale_x_continuous(label = percent) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of ABV") +
  theme_minimal()

# Boxplot of ABV
beer_brew %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = abv)) +
  geom_boxplot(
    outlier.colour = "red",
    outlier.shape = 8,
    outlier.size = 2,
    fill = bud_red
  ) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of ABV") +
  theme_minimal()
```

ABV ranges for the most part ranges between 2.5 to 10%. Most of the beers in our data set fall between 5 and 6%. There are three outliers at 12%, 12.5%, and 12.8%.

## Is there a relationship between IBU and ABV?

Is there an apparent relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content? Draw a scatter plot.  Make your best judgment of a relationship and EXPLAIN your answer.

```{r}
# Create a scatter plot of ABV and IBU
beer_brew %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ibu, y = abv)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5, color = "#044389") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "Is there a relationship Between ABV and IBU?",
       x = "IBU",
       y = "ABV") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#f3f3f2"),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#f3f3f2", color = NA),
  )

# Save the plot to the images folder
# ggsave(here::here("images", "abv and ibu relationship.png"), dpi = "retina")
```
There does appear to be some quantifiable relationship between IBU and ABV. In general, as IBU increases, ABV appears to increase as well.

## KNN

Budweiser would also like to investigate the difference with respect to IBU and ABV between IPAs (India Pale Ales) and other types of Ale (any beer with “Ale” in its name other than IPA). You decide to use KNN classification to investigate this relationship. Provide statistical evidence one way or the other. You can of course assume your audience is comfortable with percentages...KNN is very easy to understand conceptually.

In addition, while you have decided to use KNN to investigate this relationship (KNN is required) you may also feel free to supplement your response to this question with any other methods or techniques you have learned. Creativity and alternative solutions are always encouraged.  

```{r}
# Create data set of beers whose style contains only "IPA" or "Ale"
ipa_ale <- beer_brew %>% 
  mutate(style2 = as_factor(case_when(str_detect(style, "IPA") ~ "IPA",
                                      str_detect(style, "ale") ~ "Ale"))) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(style2)) %>% 
  select(style2,
         abv,
         ibu)

# Create a new standardized data set for knn
ipa_ale$abv_std <- standardize(ipa_ale$abv, centerFun = mean, scaleFun = sd)
ipa_ale$ibu_std <- standardize(ipa_ale$ibu, centerFun = mean, scaleFun = sd)

# Set seed
set.seed(123)

# Find the optimum k for predicting beer type based on IBU and ABV
# ⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼
# Set the number of iterations
iterations <- 100

# Set the number of K's to test
numks <- 30

# Create a blank matrix for holding for loop results
masterAcc <- matrix(nrow = iterations, ncol = numks)

# For loop to split the data into training and testing sets, run a KNN on each
# value of K, create a confusion matrix and add the results to our previously
# created blank matrix
for (j in 1:iterations) {
  trainInd <- sample(1:dim(ipa_ale)[1], round(0.75 * dim(ipa_ale)[1]))
  train <- ipa_ale[trainInd, ]
  test <- ipa_ale[-trainInd, ]
  
  for (i in 1:numks)
  {
    classifications <-
      knn(
        train[, c(2, 3)],
        test[, c(2, 3)],
        train$style2,
        prob = TRUE,
        k = i,
        use.all = TRUE
      )
    CM <- confusionMatrix(table(classifications, test$style2))
    masterAcc[j, i] <- CM$overall[1]
  }
}

# Calculate the column means
MeanAcc <- colMeans(masterAcc)

# Plot results
plot(seq(1, numks, 1), MeanAcc, type = "l")

# Which K was most successful.
which.max(MeanAcc)
```

Based on this look for 30 different k's, we see the optimum accuracy is at k = 3. 

```{r}
# Run the KNN model with our optimum k
trainInd <- sample(1:dim(ipa_ale)[1], round(0.75 * dim(ipa_ale)[1]))
train <- ipa_ale[trainInd,]
test <- ipa_ale[-trainInd,]
knn_model <- knn(train[, c(2, 3)], test[, c(2, 3)], train$style2, k = 3)
CM <- confusionMatrix(knn_model, test$style2)
CM
```

## Knock Their Socks Off

As we explored IBU, we noticed that the higher median IBU values tended to fall around the coasts and major metropolitan areas. That got us thinking about the relative dearth of hoppy, higher-IBU beer across much of the middle of the country and the opportunity that presents you with at Budweiser. Your brand power, trusted reputation for quality, and your distribution pipeline have placed you in an ideal position to beginn capitalizing on the popularity that higher IBU beers have begun to enjoy. 

```{r}
explore <- beer_brew %>% 
  mutate(style2 = as_factor(case_when(str_detect(style, "IPA") ~ "IPA",
                                      str_detect(style, "ale") ~ "Ale"))) %>% 
  filter(style2 == "IPA") %>% 
  count(state) %>% 
  rename(st = state,
         ipas = n) %>% 
  mutate(region = tolower(state.name[match(st,state.abb)])) 

explore <- left_join(map_data("state"), explore)
explore$ipas[is.na(explore$ipas)] <- 0

explore %>%
  mutate(ipa_potential = if_else(ipas < 10, "High", "Low")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(long, lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(fill = ipa_potential), color = "gray30") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#ffdf00", alpha("gray90", 0.5))) +
  labs(title = "Middle America Offers IPA Market",
       subtitle = "few craft brew selections present an untapped market",
       fill = "Potential") +
  coord_map() +
  theme_void() #+
  theme(
  panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#f3f3f2"),
    # bg of the panel
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#f3f3f2", color = NA),
    # bg of the plot
    legend.position = "bottom")

# ggsave(here::here("images", "ipa potential.png"), dpi = "retina")
```

## Additional Exploration

The following are additional explorations that we considered for the questions in this analysis. We opted to include it to show our thought process as well as provide ideas for future exploration.

```

## Conclusion

We were able to find some interesting insights in the data based on location, IBU, and ABV. States on the coast and with major metropolitan areas tend to have more breweries and more beer variety. Utah is a state that could benefit from more variety for low alcohol content beers in particular, and Colorado is likely an already saturated market. For most of Middle America, there is an opportunity to increase distribution or even add new breweries to allow for more variety for consumers. We also suggested 15 different styles that have the least number of existing available beers that could be considered for new beers at Budweiser.
